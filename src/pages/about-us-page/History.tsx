                Our club history starts in the Summer of 2018, with the
                inaugural Belmont Water Dog Run. Then Mayor, Doug Kim, had been
                working with Stephanie Davies and the Belmont Chamber of
                commerce to start this new local race.
              </p>
              <p>
                The weeks following up to the event, there were several
                “training runs” meeting at Water Dog Tavern; running up Lake
                Road Trail and ending with a social hour in the Beer Garden.
                Attendance for these events were between 20-30 people.

                The first Water Dog Run itself was a resounding success, with
                over 900 runners (and dogs) coming out! It was apparent that
                Belmont had a very strong running contingent, but the area
                itself did not really have a focal running club.

                Doug began to work with Theresa Saito at the Belmont Library to
                begin coordinating Thursday Evening Group runs as the official
                paperwork started to get filed.

                We held our first official run on December 6th as Belmont
                Runners.

                Over the months, we grew dramatically. The library ended its
                formal partnership with us and we looked to expand our horizons.
                Our first board formed with Doug Kim, Jon VanHorn, Kelsey Homyk,
                Oron Nadiv, Shelly Kim and Theresa Saito.
              </p>
              <p>
                The club went from meeting every other Saturday to hosting four
                runs every week. We added special event runs, beer runs, fitness
                classes – and at every turn the club was there to support us.

                We were looking to bigger and better things for 2020, until the
                pandemic changed everything. All runs were suspended and many of
                the local parks were closed. The club held a couple of virtual
                happy hours and even a running-movie night to keep our members
                engaged. We cautiously began to regroup in July as numbers
                started decreasing, but that was short lived, and we suspended
                runs again in November.

                Towards the end of 2020, our board saw its first major
                shifts as Doug, Shelly, and Oron stepped down from their
                board positions during the pandemic. Jon VanHorn
                stepped in as club president and the Board was expanded
                from five to seven members.

                By June of 2021, our club was back in full swing. Our
                events coordinator Erica began to reach out to running
                product vendors and we actually began to receive
                responses from them – with Spring Energy being the first
                to come to one of our run club events! Since then, we have
                had other reps from Hoka, Saucony and ON Running to
                name a few!
