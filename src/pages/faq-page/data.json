    "question": "I don't consider myself a very \"fast\" runner. Will I be left behind?",
    "answer": "Absolutely not. Our club is open to any runner of any ability. Our group runs are meant to be more casual and at a conversational pace. We do generally split off into natural pace groups depending on the size of the group. Also during group runs, we have several stops built in to allow everyone to catch up. We support anyone who likes running as a way of keeping healthy and fit."
